In this discussion, research an accident or disaster that was caused by a software error. Identify the error that caused the problem and what techniques could have been used to reduce the chance of the root cause occurring. Your contribution to the discussion is expected over a three-week period as follows:


**Week One – post your initial response to the discussion prompt (300-500 words). Your initial post should:**

1) Identify a product or system that failed because of a catastrophic software error.
    * Ariane 5 Flight 501 (1996)
        * Failure: A software bug caused a 64-bit floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion error, leading to an overflow and a critical guidance system failure.
        * Impact: The rocket self-destructed 40 seconds after launch, costing ~$370 million.
        * Sources:
            * European Space Agency Report - https://www.esa.int/Newsroom/Press_Releases/Ariane_501_-_Presentation_of_Inquiry_Board_report
            * Report by the Inquiry Board - http://sunnyday.mit.edu/nasa-class/Ariane5-report.html
2) Explain what caused the error, for example buffer overflow or miscommunication in the software team.
3) Explain the sequence of events that led to the error being made.
4) Explain what the consequence of the error was, for example loss of life or profit.


**Week Two – respond to two or three of your peer's first posts (300-500 words). Your post should include:**

1) Resolutions to the errors created in the original product.
2) Identify what current tools / techniques could be used to prevent this type of problem occurring in other products.
3) Identify which edge / non-mainstream techniques such as provable systems could be used to eliminate any chance of this error for being repeated.


**Week Three – compose an executive critical summary of your initial response and the responses you received from your peers (500 words max). In the executive critical summary, you should synthesise the discussion you had with your peers over your initial post, highlighting the significant points, and critically analyse the different perspectives and any changes in the way you might have thought initially about the chosen case study. In the unlikely event your initial post has received no additional comments from your peers, identify and describe what current tools / techniques could be used to prevent this type of problem and to eliminate any chance of this error being repeated.**

In each discussion post, ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). You should also demonstrate that you understand all the topics, so your posts should include references to the importance of group programming techniques, testing, requirements elicitation and modelling and how this relates to reducing catastrophic failure.

Once submitted, you have 1 hour to edit your discussion post if you want to make any changes. Please carefully review your post before submitting it.

To prepare for this discussion please review the week's reading list and introductory lecturecast.

Only the final summary post is subject to the late submission penalty (third week discussion forum deadline). Other posts submitted after their respective deadlines would not be subject to the late penalty but submitting late would have a negative impact on the final grade because of the "discussion forum engagement and responsiveness" criterium in the marking rubric.Y
